# Sequence Guessing Game

A React-based mathematical sequence guessing game that challenges players to identify patterns and predict the next number in various sequences.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/helenafsd/sequence-guess.git
cd sequence-guess
```


2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```


3. Start the development server:

```bash
npm start
```


4. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`

Note: Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed on your system before running these commands.


## Description

This game presents players with different types of mathematical sequences and asks them to predict the next number in each sequence. It includes various types of sequences:

- Arithmetic sequences (adding a constant)
- Geometric sequences (multiplying by a constant)
- Square number sequences
- Factorial sequences
- Multiply and add sequences (e.g., n * 3 + 2)
- Square and add sequences (e.g., nÂ² + 3)

## Features

- 10 randomly generated sequences per game
- Immediate feedback on guesses
- Helpful hints when incorrect
- Clean, retro-style terminal interface
- Mobile-friendly design

## How to Play

1. Look at each sequence of numbers
2. Try to identify the pattern
3. Enter your guess for what the next number should be
4. Click "Check" to see if you're correct
5. If incorrect, a hint about the sequence type will be shown
6. Refresh the page to get new sequences

## Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies
3. Run `npm start` to start the development server
4. Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser
